# About the project

*Introduction to Open Data Science is a MOOC about open data, open science, and data science. In this course we are not afraid of programming. We learn to use R, RStudio, RMarkdown, and GitHub with GitHub Desktop.  Here is the link to my GitHub repository: <https://github.com/irmada/IODS-project>.*
